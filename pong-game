# This is my rendition of the Pong Game using the Turtle module.
# Throughout this project, I gained insight into 
# creating classes, inheriting classes, initialising attributes, 
# and understanding the Turtle game engine.


# Most comments are notes for personal information regarding 
# key takeaways within the code!
